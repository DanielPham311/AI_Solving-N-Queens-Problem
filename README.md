# AI_Solving-N-Queens-Problem

## This is a mini LAB project for Artificial Intelligence in HCMUS
## The following project solves the N-Queens Problem (find a way to place N queens on an NxN chess board so that none of the queens are attacking each other) using the following ways

### 1. Using Uniform-Cost Search
### 2. Using the A* searching algorithm with the MIN-CONFLICT heuristics: "the number of ATTACKING pairs of queens"
### 3. Genetic Algorithm with the objective function defined from the above heuristics

This program will also show the variation in run time and memory usage in the three search methods with an increasing value of N
