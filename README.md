# AI_Solving-N-Queens-Problem

## This is a mini LAB project for Artificial Intelligence in HCMUS
## The following project solves the N-Queens Problem using the following ways

## Explaination: Solving the N-Queens problem practically revolves around finding a way to place N queens on an NxN chess board so that none of the queens are attacking each other

### 1. Using Uniform-Cost Search algorithm
#### This method simply utilizes the UCS Searching algorithm to solve the N-Queens problem

### 2. Using the A* searching algorithm with the MIN-CONFLICT heuristics: "the number of ATTACKING pairs of queens"

### 3. Genetic Algorithm with the objective function defined from the above heuristics

This program will also show the variation in run time and memory usage in the three search methods with an increasing value of N where N is the number of queens on the board. Many test cases were used (4 queens, 8 queens, 40 queens, etc...) and it has come to conclusion that this algorithm can only solve the problem with 15 queens in an acceptable time limit.
